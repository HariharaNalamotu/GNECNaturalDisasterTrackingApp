# GNECNaturalDisasterTrackingApp
GNEC project to map natural disasters based on data from EONET

# Idea
EONET and NASA have amazing data, but no interface to view it comprehendably. I found that to be a problem when I tried to see where the highest concentration of disasters were, so I came up with an interface to display them.

# Dependencies
- Folium
- PyQt5
- QtWebEngine
Without these dependencies, the code will not run.

# Warning
When the code is run, it will output a warning about the SSL certificate. Please disregard this.
